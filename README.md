# multitemporal_sdm_assessment

## GitHub repository for the paper *Assessing multitemporal calibration for species distribution models*

Here we provide the source code for the computational experiment. A minimal example parametrization is provided (see the comments along the code in the main script, `main_script.R`). For the minimal example runing, please dowload the required data, at the Mendeley Data repository (this [link](https://data.mendeley.com/drafts/3fx9wx7pby)). Such climate variables is all you need to run all the steps of our experiment pipeline. 

For the fully reproduction of our results, please dowload the full climate data, provided at DRYAD (this [link](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8kc1v)). After that, decompress all the files and locate it at a folder called `climate_data`, in the main project folder. For your convenience, we also provide an accessory script (see `decompressor.bat` file) for recursive decompression of the climate data files.

The conceptual description of the experiment pipeline is depicted in the following figure.
